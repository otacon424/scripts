# macOS Scripts

## Description
The scripts for the macOS operating system. To help me setup and run my
development environments for it.

The plan is to seperate each version of macOS into seperate folders, along with
the install scripts for each one.

### Tahoe

This is the latest version of macOS and the one I will spend writing my scripts
for. Note that the previous versions of macOS from High Sierra to Ventura
homebrew stopped it's support. Though it's a longshot, I would like to
eventually help create a dedicated package manager for the older versions.

#### Install Script

The will include the hombrew commands for installation. As well as the packages
used.
