# scripts
A repository holding my various different scripts for different systems.
Will be learning to add either different md files and such to the the main.

## AntiX - Debian Bookworm

I have been utilizing AntiX for my server distro because of how lightweight it
is on my old laptop. Plan on utilizing it as a Pi-hole, Jellyfin, Samba, and
basic Apache and Nginx server for testing my websites and maintaining my repos
on Github and Gitlab respectively. Since Windows doesn't play well with Ruby,
Jekyll and Gitlab.

WSL also stopped working for me, so I will be working on both this AntiX Server
I for all my aforementioned server needs and such. Scripts will be added into
the main branch under the folder antiX.

## macOS Tahoe

I have a Macbook Pro running macOS Tahoe. All related scripts will be added
under the folder macos, subfolder tahoe.
